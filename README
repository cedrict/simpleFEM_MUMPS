INSTALLATION
++++++++++++++++++++
Assuming you have installed MUMPS correctly,
simply tune the Makefile.machine to your machine.
MUMPS requires BLAS. You can compile your own
BLAS library, or you can use the one provided 
by your operating system.
For instance, for Mac OSX, it is called "framework Accelerate".

Then simply do

make code2D

or 

make code3D

If all goes well, you should now have the 'simplefem' 
executable.

Simply run it with 
./simplefem



If you wish to look at timings, run it as follows:
./run

note that
dmumps_c.h
dmumps_root.h
dmumps_struc.h
mpif.h 
should come from your MUMPS install folders.
